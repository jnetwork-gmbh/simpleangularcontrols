project can be defined via the ConfigurationService. An abstract service is available to ensure that all configurations are always available. When the library is updated, additional settings may need to be configured.\nChange settings project wide\nExample of an implementation of a project-specific configuration\nExample :import { SacAbstractConfigurationService } from '@simpleangularcontrols/sac-common';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root',\n})\nexport class CustomConfigurationService extends SacAbstractConfigurationService {\n  get ComponentHeight(): ControlHeight | null {\n    return ControlHeight.Default;\n  }\n  get CurrencyText(): string {\n    return 'CHF';\n  }\n  get InlineErrorEnabled(): boolean {\n    return true;\n  }\n  get LabelSizeLg(): number | null {\n    return 3;\n  }\n  get LabelSizeMd(): number | null {\n    return 4;\n  }\n  get LabelSizeSm(): number | null {\n    return 4;\n  }\n  get LabelSizeXl(): number | null {\n    return 2;\n  }\n  get LabelSizeXs(): number | null {\n    return 12;\n  }\n  get LabelSizeXxl(): number | null {\n    return 2;\n  }\n}The service must be defined in the application via the injection token SACCONFIGURATION_SERVICE in the NgModule.\nExample :@NgModule({\n  ...\n  providers: [\n    { provide: SACCONFIGURATION_SERVICE, useClass: CustomConfigurationService },\n  ],\n  ...\n})Label below inputs\nTo display labels above the control, you must create a ConfigurationService in which the value 12 is defined for all LabelSize properties.\n\n    \n\n    \n        import { Injectable, InjectionToken } from '@angular/core';\nimport { ControlHeight } from '../enums/ControlHeight';\nimport { ISacConfigurationService } from

Custom Configuration\nThe default settings for the entire project can be defined via the ConfigurationService. An abstract service is available to ensure that all configurations are always available. When the library is updated, additional settings may need to be configured.\nChange settings project wide\nExample of an implementation of a project-specific configuration\nExample :import { SacAbstractConfigurationService } from '@simpleangularcontrols/sac-common';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root',\n})\nexport class CustomConfigurationService extends SacAbstractConfigurationService {\n  get ComponentHeight(): ControlHeight | null {\n    return ControlHeight.Default;\n  }\n  get CurrencyText(): string {\n    return 'CHF';\n  }\n  get InlineErrorEnabled(): boolean {\n    return true;\n  }\n  get LabelSizeLg(): number | null {\n    return 3;\n  }\n  get LabelSizeMd(): number | null {\n    return 4;\n  }\n  get LabelSizeSm(): number | null {\n    return 4;\n  }\n  get LabelSizeXl(): number | null {\n    return 2;\n  }\n  get LabelSizeXs(): number | null {\n    return 12;\n  }\n  get LabelSizeXxl(): number | null {\n    return 2;\n  }\n}The service must be defined in the application via the injection token SACCONFIGURATION_SERVICE in the NgModule.\nExample :@NgModule({\n  ...\n  providers: [\n    { provide: SACCONFIGURATION_SERVICE, useClass: CustomConfigurationService },\n  ],\n  ...\n})Label below inputs\nTo display labels above the control, you must create a ConfigurationService in which the value 12 is defined for all LabelSize

Forms\nkeine Gruppierung der Formulare durch die Direktive \"ngModelGroup\" möglich war.\nWenn in einer Kompontene über @ViewChild auf die NgFormular Komponente zugegriffen wird, muss das Attribute auf dem Form auf folgenden Code\nangepasst werden '#myForm=\"NgFormular\"'.\n\nDas Property \"form\" in NgFormular ist neu Private. Auf \"form\" kann über die Methode \"getForm()\" zugegriffen werden.\n\n\nV.1.1.1\nBreaking Changes\n\nBeim Tag \"\" wurde das Property \"iconstyle\" in 2 Properties \"iconstyle\" und \"icon\" aufgeteilt. Werden die Standard Icons verwendet,\nmuss das Property von \"inconstyle\" auf \"icon\" umbenannt werden. Werden Custom Icons verwendet, muss das Sprite Set im Property \"iconstyle\" angegeben werden und\ndas Icon im Property \"icon\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"contributing.html":{"url":"contributing.html","title":"getting-started - contributing","body":"\n                   \n\n﻿These packages are maintained and updated by exanic AG and jNetwork GmbH.\nThe packages may be used freely.

The common library, the Bootstrap-specific library and the demo project for the specific Bootstrap version.\nThe logic of the controls is to be implemented in the common library. It does not contain any definitions about the rendering of the control\nThe markup for the respective Bootstrap version must be implemented in the Boostrap-specific library. No custom styles should be implemented, instead the standard Bootstrap classes should be used. In individual exceptions, specific styles may be necessary for the controls. However, this is only permitted if there is no other option and no styles may be used for colour definitions and shapes.\nExample :graph TD\n    Common --> Boostrap3 --> DemoBootstrap3[Demo Boostrap 3];\n    Common --> Boostrap4 --> DemoBootstrap4[Demo Boostrap 4];\n    Common --> Boostrap5 --> DemoBootstrap5[Demo Boostrap 5];Run\nTo start the environment, 3 projects must be carried out.\nBootstrap 3\n\nStart Common: npm run run-common\nStart Boostrap3: npm run run-bs3\nStart Demo: npm run demo-bs3\n\nBoostrap 3 Demo runs under URL: http://localhost:4200\nBootstrap 4\n\nStart Common: npm run run-common\nStart Boostrap4: npm run run-bs4\nStart Demo: npm run demo-bs4\n\nBoostrap 4 Demo runs under URL: http://localhost:4201\nBootstrap 5\n\nStart Common: npm run run-common\nStart Boostrap5: npm run run-bs5\nStart Demo: npm run demo-bs5\n\nBoostrap 5 Demo runs under URL: http://localhost:4202\nBuild\nTo create a build without a live update, the following commands can be executed\nCommon\nExample :npm run build-commonBootstrap 3\nExample :npm run build-bs3Bootstrap 4\nExample :npm run build-bs4Bootstrap 5\nExample :npm run build-bs5Documentation\nTo update all documentation, it is recommended to use the corresponding build command. This updates the documentation for all projects.\nUpdate all documentation\nExample :./build.ps1 --target=docBoostrap 3\nThis command only updates the Boostrap 3 documentation\nExample :npm run-script compodoc-bs3Boostrap 4\nThis command only updates the Boostrap 4 documentation\nExample :npm run-script compodoc-bs4Boostrap 5\nThis command only updates the Boostrap 3 documentation\nExample :npm run-script compodoc-bs5Testing\nCreate/Edit Tests\nTo create or edit tests, execute the following command\nBoostrap 3\nExample :npm run test-edit-bs3Boostrap 4\nExample :npm run test-edit-bs4Boostrap 5\nExample :npm run test-edit-bs5Run Tests\nThe following commands are available to start the tests\nFull Run\nThis command is used for the tests for all projects.\nExample :./build.ps1 --target=testBoostrap 3\nExample :npm run test-bs3Boostrap 4\nExample :npm run test-bs4Boostrap 5\nExample :npm run test-bs5Problems\nType DynamicModule does not have 'ɵmod' property.\nIf these error messages are displayed during a test, the NGCC must be executed again. To do this, execute the following command.\nExample :npm run ngccBuild Pipeline\nRequirements\nThe following command must be executed for the Powershell script to be executed, Otherwise the following error is displayed:\nExample :./build.ps1 : File C:\\Daten\\jNetwork\\ch.jnetwork.angularcontrols\\build.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled\non this system.

for all projects, execute the following command in a Powershell\nExample :build.ps1Test Run\nTo execute all tests in a Powershell, execute the following command\nExample :build.ps1
